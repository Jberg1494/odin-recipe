        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound bulk mild Italian sausage</li>
            <li>1 ¼ teaspoons crushed red pepper flakes</li>
            <li>4 slices bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 large onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li>5 (13.75 ounce) cans chicken broth</li>
            <li>6 medium potatoes, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>¼ bunch fresh spinach, tough stems removed</li>
        </ul>
<p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
<ol>
    <li>Cook Italian sausage and red pepper flakes in a Dutch oven over medium-high<br> 
        heat until crumbly, browned, and no longer pink, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain and set<br>
         aside.</li>
    <li>Cook bacon in the same Dutch oven over medium heat until crisp, about 10<br>
         minutes. Drain, leaving a few tablespoons of drippings with the bacon in the<br> 
         bottom of the Dutch oven. Stir in onions and garlic; cook until onions are soft<br> 
         and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Stir in chicken broth and bring to a boil over high heat. Add potatoes and<br>
         simmer until fork tender, about 20 minutes. Reduce heat to medium; stir in<br>
          cream, cooked sausage, and spinach. Cook and stir until spinach has wilted<br>
           and sausage is warmed through; serve.</li>
</ol>
